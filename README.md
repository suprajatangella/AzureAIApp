AI-Powered Console Application with Azure & OpenAI

This console application demonstrates how to combine **Azure AI services** and **OpenAI** to build intelligent document and image processing features. It showcases real-world use cases such as OCR, image caption generation, invoice/business card field extraction, and conversational AI interactions.

‚ú® Features

- OCR ‚Äì Extract printed or handwritten text from images.
- Image Captioning ‚Äì Generate natural-language descriptions of images.
- Document Intelligence ‚Äì Extract structured data from:
  - Invoices
  - Business Cards
- OpenAI GPT-3.5-Turbo ‚Äì Interact with a language model to summarize data, generate insights, or provide smart responses.

üß† AI Services & Tools Used

Azure AI Foundry
Used for managing AI model lifecycles and connecting multiple services in one place. This platform simplifies orchestration of AI resources.

Azure AI Document Intelligence Studio
Used to explore and test prebuilt models for:
- Invoices: Extract billing data, vendor info, totals, and tax details.
- Business Cards: Extract contact details like name, email, company, phone.

Azure Vision ‚Äì Image Analysis
Used to:
- Perform OCR on image files.
- Generate captions describing image content (e.g., "a man holding a sign").

Azure OpenAI (GPT-3.5-Turbo)
Used to:
- Generate responses from extracted data.
- Summarize document contents or OCR results.
- Enable intelligent chat features.
